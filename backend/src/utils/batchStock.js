// SelAmount, MRP and PurchaseRate (P.Rate less Disc%) are the batch's pack
// prices from its latest Stock In line, else MRP and In price from its latest
// Adjust In (null for batches from older screens). A batch is the item + its batch number ('' when it had none), the

// "sold", so editing a sale can reuse the stock it already took;
// `excludeAdjustmentId` likewise leaves one Stock Adjustment out.
// Stock Adjustments count too: Adjust In as received, Adjust Out as returned.
// Earliest expiry first; batches without an expiry go last.
